The Learning Management System (LMS) project is an innovative online platform designed to facilitate effective learning experiences for educators and students. This comprehensive system distinguishes between two key user roles: educators and students, each playing a distinct role in the learning process. Educators are granted exclusive privileges to create, manage, and curate educational content, ensuring a dynamic and tailored learning experience. On the other hand, students benefit from straightforward enrollment processes, gaining access to a diverse array of courses crafted by educators. The LMS emphasizes a user-friendly and responsive interface, allowing seamless interaction with educational material across devices.
